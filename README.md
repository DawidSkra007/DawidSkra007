### Hi there 👋

My name is Dawid Skraba, and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from University College Dublin 🎓. I'm a recent Graduate Software Engineer with a passion for coding 🖥️ and a strong foundation in various programming languages.

During my time at UCD, I had the opportunity to delve into a diverse range of technologies and projects, which has honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of software development. I have used a wide range of proggraming languages and I've enjoyed the challenges each language presents. I'm excited about learning more and advancing my career in this exciting space.
